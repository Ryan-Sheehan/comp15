## Static vs. Dynamic Arrays
- ArrayList is an abstract data type
- underlying array
- can be static or dynamic

## Categories of data structure functions
- **Mutator**: modify the data structure
- **Accessor**: does __not__ modify data structure
	`const` member functions

The reason that we don't declare data structures to be large enough to account for any possible scenario is that that even the unused space takes up space in memory

Static Array | Dynamic Array 
------------ | -------------
allocate at compile time | allocate at run-time
`Pirate pirates;` | `Pirate *pirates; Pirates = new Pirate[n];`
execution stack | heap 
cannot be resized | can kind of be resized
You can use the stack if you know exactly how much data you need to allocate before compile time and it is not too big.	| You can use heap if you don't know exactly how much data you will need at runtime or if you need to allocate a lot of data.

Psuedocode for expand function

'''
int MAX = 10; // Current allocated max size
int* = new int[MAX]; // Allocate space in heap
int n = 0; // Current num of elements

// Read into the array
while (cin >> a[n]) {
	n++;
	if ( n >= MAX) {
		MAX = MAX * 2; // Double the previous size*
		int* temp = new int[MAX]; // Allocate new, bigger array

		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			temp[i] = a[i]; // Copy old array to new array

		delete [] a; // Free old array memory
		a = temp; // Now points to a new array
'''
&ast;this entire process is intensive, we don't want to do it often so we double the max size when we must expand so that we don't have to expand often
