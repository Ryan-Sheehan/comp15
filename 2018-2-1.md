Pointers in a LinkedList

	NodeType *curr = head; // curr is now pointed to what head was pointing to (head was pointer to a node type)
	while (curr->next != NULL) // next is a member of a struct
	curr = curr->next;
	delete curr;

### LinkedList Implementation

	class LinkedList
	{
		public:
			.
			.
			.
		private:
			NodeType *head;
			int length;
	}


Insert function
	- client provides Planet object
	- allocate NodeType on heap
	- set NodeType's info to planet
	- update pointers

To dereference a pointer, do `(*node).info = p;` this is equivalent to `node->info = p;`

### Rule of 3
If your class has dynamic memory, then you need:
1. Destructor
2. Copy Constructor
3. Assignment operator

#### What is a copy constructor?
Say I have:
	LinkedList l;
	LinkedList l2;
	l = l2;

This makes a shallow copy which is not what we want. A shallow copy simply points to the same place in memory rather than creating a seperate object that has all of the same elements. `l2.insert(Pluto)` would also add Pluto to `l` because it is changing the same memory.


##### How to write a copy constructor
What you need:
1. `LinkedList` you're making a copy of
2. `LinkedList` that wants to be a copy of the other one
