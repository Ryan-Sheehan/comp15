#### Data abstraction
- This is the concept of seperating implementation from logic
- **Implementation (implementator)**
	- Class definition for data structure
	- Big picture

			class Array
			{
			private:
				int ray[max];
				int size;
				.
				.
				.
			}
	- _What functions would we want to implement for this class?_
		- Add element (append to the end)
		- Insert element (specified location)
		- Remove element
		- Sort
		- Average
		- Get element at an index
		- Search for an element and see if it exists in the array
		- Find min/max 
		- Swap
		- Goal (what you need on all the rest of the projects to get a specified grade)

- **Logic (client)**
	- Driver for a specific application
	- call functions of the class

			Array a;
			a.insert(97);
			a.insert(98);
			.
			.
			.
