# Runtime Complexity

- Measuring the efficiency of an algorithm
	1. Size of input
	2. # of steps relative to n as n grows arbitrarily large
- Dealt in worse case scenarios
	- The upper bound
- Types of runtime complexity
	*These are generally good:*
	- Constant _*O(1)*_: runtime complexity is independent of the number of elements n
	- Linear _*O(n)*_: worse case is that the algorithm takes as many steps as there are elements n
	- Logarithmic _*O(lgn)*_: 
	- Polynomial _*O(n^k)*_:
	*These are generally bad:*
	- Exponential _*O(k^n)*_:
	- Factorial _*O(n!)*_:

- NP complete problems have no known solution

# Linked List Operations
- LL offers:
	- Dynamic memory
	- No expand / copy
	- Length == capacity
	- Every element is a NodeType
	'''
	struct NodeType
	{
		Planet info;
		NodeType \*next;
	};
	'''
	- Head always points to the first element
	- Last element's next always points to null
	- Not contiguous in memory
	- Allocate NodeTypes one at a time
	- When you insert new elements to a LL they always go to the beginning


# LinkedList vs. ArrayList
- If you're going to be adding and deleting things a lot, a `LinkedList` is probably better; however, if you are creating and deleting whole arrays frequently without changing their contents much, an `ArrayList` is probably better for your needs

- AL w/ static array
	- is_ful: is length == capacity
- LL:
	- is_full: is there any memory left?


### Exceptions

An exception disrupts flow of control
	- out of memory
	- divide by zero

For example: C++ throws an exception when __new__ doesn't work

'''
MyData md;  
try {  
   // Code that could throw an exception  
   md = GetNetworkResource();  
}  
catch (const networkIOException& e) {  
   // Code that executes when an exception of type  
   // networkIOException is thrown in the try block  
   // ...  
   // Log error message in the exception object  
   cerr << e.what();  
}  
catch (const myDataFormatException& e) {  
   // Code that handles another exception type  
   // ...  
   cerr << e.what();  
}  
  
// The following syntax shows a throw expression  
MyData GetNetworkResource()  
{  
   // ...  
   if (IOSuccess == false)  
      throw networkIOException("Unable to connect");  
   // ...  
   if (readError)  
      throw myDataFormatException("Format error");   
   // ...  
}
