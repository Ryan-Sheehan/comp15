===============================

Reading: Shaffer 4.2-4.3

__Outline__:
1. Copy constructor and assignment operator
2. Queue as Abstract Data Type
3. Queue as Linked Structure

##### Copy + Assignment
- Copy constructor when making a new object
- Assignment operator updates **existing** object
	LL mylist;
	LL l2; //default constructor
	l2 = mylist; // assg operator
	LL l3 = foo(mylist);

##### Queue Abstract Data Type

__Everything FIFO__: First on, first off

__Don't care__: 
- value at a position
- position of a value
- length of a queue
- if a specific value exists
- about deleting a specific value

When you would want to use this:
Used by OS that have a queue of processes to run
